i write you here because i can't find any email adresse.

i have seen your issue about http firmware update. in your zip you included php code and i have seen that you are not using prepared statements.

so i tried it out and yep i can break your code.

you should never use mysql_query php function. use Mysql PDO with prepared statments
php explains it how you should use it
https://secure.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php


as an example for sql injection

`curl -X POST "http://autat.gmstrans.cz/cu/firmware.php?action=setversion&imei=testtest"`
output:

```Firmware je stejny
Query failed: Unknown column 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeee' in 'where clause'```

i hope you are not angry. i only want to help you!!!!
